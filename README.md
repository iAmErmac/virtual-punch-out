# Virtual Punch Out

![Virtual Punch Out](https://i.imgur.com/L1QymWX.jpeg)

Ever wondered what Punchout would be like if it was in 3D? Well now you can find out just how different it is than you might think. Dodge heavy blows, duck swinging punches, perform heavy combos on your opponents, and even train with doc! This wad contains all of the opponents from Mike Tysons Punchout and Punchout with Mr. Dream, as well as extra characters, such as Gabby Jay, Masked Muscle, Rick Bruiser, and Aran Ryan. Then, when you've defeated all your main opponents, fight the ones again who dare challenge your title. You have two attack types, pressing one will make you punch up, while pressing two will make you punch lower, the default. Tired of just being in the ring? Fight against your enemys on the streets in the secret level. and At the end of it all, you'll have to take down the most powerful boxer Mike Tyson.

VR Edition of this mod brings VR Specific features like full motion punching (optional) and blocking. Make sure to enable natural crouch in VR options (in QuestZDoomm) so you can duck with full immersion.
